# PyndIt
My first python project. Find the random number the game selected from a range of your choosing in 5 or less chances. Good luck


This is a simple text based game created in python to learn about python 
In this game you create a user and input a number of your liking which will create a range from 1 to that number
Next the game picks a random number within that range which you have to guess it out 
You have 5 chances to guess the number correctly and the game hints if your guess is near or far from the answer
Use it your advanatage and find the answer 
And if you fail to find it in 5 or less guesses then you fail and the game will show the answer to you 
Good Luck !
