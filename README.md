# Pynd It

My first complete project in python.

Game:          
Pynd It is a simple text based game made in python to learn python.
The classic 'Guess the number' game with an added twist of custom range for random selection where you the user can select the range for random number selection. 
And with added update the Score system now calculates the score based on your selected range, So higher the risk higher the score.
Also another update is Chance system which calcluates the number of chances based on the user's selected range  

Instructions:             
The game is simple with walking instructions, You as the user input a name and the range you want the random number be selected from.
Guess the number selected by the algorithm after this in the lowest tries possible to get the highest score. Good luck.
